## continue to practice code & upskill

You must continue to practice to code wether they are personal hobby projects,
or learning tutorials. They key to reducing your impostor syndrome is making continuous effort
at learning and practice to become more confident of your skill and craft.

## Don't Forget Where you Started

One day, not so long ago, you were just starting. A beginner, that wouldn't be able to pick out an integer from a float. Now you've written full-stack applications, have worked in a team using Git, have not only talked the talk but are walking the walk.

When your fingers are at a keyboard, magic happens. An empty folder is quickly populated with a city of files filled with business of data, and citizens of functions. From nothing: something!

This should not be taken lightly. Don't just look, but feel where you are now compared to that humble beginning. Say it aloud:

> I can write programs. I know multiple programming languages. I can read documentation. I can build a web application, and already have!

Like one of your favourite booleans, that statement is `true`.

Spend real time looking back to admire your progress, reflect on the present and what needs to be done, and keep an eye to what is yet to come!

## Where You're Going

Seniors don't know everything. They oft' just know how to get to an answer faster. They've learned how to learn, how to parse documentation and take the important bits quickly. If you do something everyday, sure you'll memorize the commands you use all the time, but more important than that in this forever shifting landscape is your ability to adapt.

Be willing to try, have something not work, and to try again. Experiment. `git commit`, break things, and roll back. Try things! Keep trying things until it works. Persistance and tenacity are the key.

## Be Proud

* You've grown, and learned, a lot!

    * You HAVE written code that works.
    * You've built a project with a team.
    * You've built a web application.
    * You **ARE** a developer! Say it aloud, and let it sink in.
